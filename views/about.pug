            | I was always fascinated by the impact of technologies in our lives, and software development stood out to be the most interesting field, which led me to do some self-learning and I eventually joined a coding bootcamp.
            | I am now working as an intern at a software company and also a talentpath student at a techdegree program.
            | At this point I have gained the skills needed to be a full-stack web developer.
            | I believe that being a web developer means life-long learning, which I am really excited about.
