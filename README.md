# description
In this project, I have created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I have built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page and a series of project pages.

# libraries and dependencies
Node.js and Express
JSON and Pug templates

# Changes added in Styling
- Background color for body
- Background color for thumbnail
- Font styling and changes
- Box shadow size and color changes

# Deployment
To deploy the project, download the project files, Run the command 'npm install' on your terminal to install the project dependencies, then run the command 'npm start' to run the application. The application will be running on localhost:3000

# Extra credits
- Setted up the package.json file so that running npm start will run the app.

- error.pug file is created, such that when the request URL is for a non-existent route, the error.pug template is displayed in the browser along with the following properties:
error.message
error.status
error.stack

- Changed more than 3 styling properties
